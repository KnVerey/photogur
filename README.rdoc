== Photogur: Project description

This was the first Rails project at Bitmaker Labs. It is a photo-sharing app that replicates the basic functions of Imgur. Although I built it using a tutorial the first time through, this posted version was built tutorial-free. This is the only project where I used Bootstrap.
